## Before compile:
There are several things to do before running this bot.

**Step 1:** you must register your telegram bot. There are a lot of guides in the internet, find any and do it!

**Step 2:** you should prepare 1 dedicated IP addresses for telegram webhooks.
<br>I used [serveo](https://serveo.net/) for testing, it's free and don't have CORS restrictions.

**Step 3:** you must fill [application.properties](telegrambot/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

| --------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------:|
|server.port                        |port number on which your application will run|
|telegrambot.botUsername            |telegram bot username, starts with '@'        |
|telegrambot.botToken               |token from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)|
|telegrambot.webHookPath            |first dedicated IP address                    |
|telegrambot.adminKey               |password for admins in your shop              |
|telegrambot.webappUrl              |second dedicated IP address                   |
|images.folder                      |absolute path to images storage               |
|spring.datasource.url              |url to your database                          |
|spring.datasource.username         |database username                             |
|spring.datasource.password         |database password                             |
|spring.datasource.driver-class-name|name of the JDBC driver                       |

**Step 4:** you should create 3 empty tables - `product`, `users`, `image`. Hibernate will create columns by itself.
<br>Preparations of bot is ended at this step.

After you need to prepare webapp. The only thing you need to do is to deploy [webapp](https://github.com/aeldridg42/tg_bot_for_sales/tree/main/webapp). You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
## How to compile:
Run `./mvnw clean package` in [telegrambot](https://github.com/aeldridg42/tg_bot_for_sales/tree/main/telegrambot) folder and you will get tg_bot_for_sales.jar which you can run locally or deploy somewhere.
